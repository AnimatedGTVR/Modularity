# Building & Testing Modularity
In Simple: `build.sh` is the entry point for all builds. It locates the repo root, installs system dependencies, syncs submodules + git-lfs, configures CMake, builds, and packages.
See `CLAUDE.md` for the full flag list. (it's human readable too, no worries!)
```bash
./build.sh                       # Native (Linux) Release build [faster due to the default packaging being zip]
./build.sh --7z                  # Builds with Packaging using 7z, much slower to compress, but much smaller as well
./build.sh --clean               # Wipe build dirs first
./build.sh --build-type=Debug    # Builds in Debug Mode
./build.sh --fsanitize           # AddressSanitizer + UBSan (-DMODULARITY_ENABLE_ASAN=ON)
./build.sh --Windows             # Cross-compile Windows via MinGW-w64
./build.sh --jobs=N              # Parallel jobs (default: nproc-2)
./build.sh --generator=Ninja     # Builds using Ninja
./buildandrun.sh                 # Build.sh then run the resulting binary
```

## CPU / ISA target (x86_64 compatibility)
**Public Linux releases target baseline x86-64 so they run on any 64-bit x86 CPU.**
This is the default and you normally do not need to touch it.
Higher microarchitecture levels bake in newer instruction sets (SSE4, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512).
A binary built for a level the running CPU doesn't support
is rejected by the dynamic loader at startup with: `./Modularity: CPU ISA level is lower than required`
(or crashes later with `SIGILL`).

To keep releases portable, the build pins the CPU target with `MODULARITY_CPU_TARGET`:
MODULARITY_CPU_TARGET   | Compiler flags                    | Intended for
`baseline` *(default)*  | `-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic`    | **Public releases**, runs on any x86-64
`x86-64-v2`             | `-march=x86-64-v2 -mtune=generic` | ~2009+ CPUs (SSE4.2, POPCNT)
`x86-64-v3`             | `-march=x86-64-v3 -mtune=generic` | ~2015+ CPUs (AVX2, BMI, FMA)
`x86-64-v4`             | `-march=x86-64-v4 -mtune=generic` | AVX-512 CPUs only
`native`                | `-march=native -mtune=native`     | **Dev only**, tuned to *your* machine

From the build script:
```bash
./build.sh                         # baseline
./build.sh --cpu-target=x86-64-v3  # opt into a higher level
./build.sh --native                # developer perf testing: DO NOT SHIP
```
Or directly to CMake: `-DMODULARITY_CPU_TARGET=baseline`.

### Why this matters even on a "normal" `-march=x86-64`
The flag is applied **globally** (`CMAKE_C/CXX_FLAGS`), not just to engine targets,
so the vendored third-party libraries (assimp, GLFW, Dear ImGui, Jolt, zlib, PhysX)
are pinned to the same level. This is required on distributions whose compiler **defaults** to a higher ISA,

for example: **CachyOS ships GCC configured for `-march=x86-64-v3`**,
so without the explicit baseline flag every dependency would silently emit AVX2
and the release would crash on older CPUs.

Jolt is a special case: it advertises its SIMD flags (`-mavx2`, `-mavx512f`, …)
as **PUBLIC** usage requirements, which leak into the engine executable.
Its `USE_SSE4_*/USE_AVX*` switches are therefore driven entirely from
`MODULARITY_CPU_TARGET` in the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
so the bundled physics lib can never push a release above the requested baseline.

### The CRT ISA note
On some distros (again, CachyOS and similar performance-tuned images) the C
runtime startup objects (`Scrt1.o` / `crt1.o`)
are themselves built for a high ISA level. They get linked into **every** executable and stamp a
`.note.gnu.property` "x86 ISA needed: x86-64-v3/-v4" onto the binary
regardless of `-march`. That note is what the loader checks.

For the **baseline** target the build strips this note from the produced
executables (`objcopy --remove-section .note.gnu.property`, wired as a CMake `POST_BUILD` step).
Because the baseline target also forces *all* code to
baseline ISA, the stripped binary is genuinely safe to run anywhere. Higher
targets keep the honest note as a real safety gate.

## Release verification
`tools/verify-cpu-isa.sh` is the release gate. It runs `readelf -n` over the
main executables and every bundled `.so`, prints each binary's x86 ISA notes, and **fails** (exit 1)

if any binary *requires* an ISA level above the allowed maximum.
`build.sh` runs it automatically after packaging on native Linux builds
(it is skipped for `--native`, which is dev-only).
To run it by hand:
```bash
tools/verify-cpu-isa.sh --max-level=baseline build/         # scan a dir
tools/verify-cpu-isa.sh --max-level=baseline ./Modularity   # scan a file
readelf -n ./Modularity | grep -i -A4 "x86"                 # manual spot-check
```
A passing baseline release shows `x86 ISA needed: (none)` (note stripped) or
`x86-64-baseline`, and never `x86-64-v3` / `x86-64-v4`.
If the verifier flags a **bundled third-party `.so`** (e.g. a system FFmpeg
copied from a CachyOS host) as requiring v3/v4, that library genuinely uses
those instructions and cannot be made portable by stripping a note. Rebuild it
generically or build the public release on a generic-toolchain host/container.
