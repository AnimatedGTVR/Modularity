## 1. What ModuCPP is

ModuCPP is the scripting language we use to write gameplay, UI, and editor logic in the Modularity engine. Scripts live in `.moducpp` files and look a bit like C# — you write a class, declare some fields, and implement a few well-known methods like `Begin()` and `TickUpdate()`.

Where it differs from a typical scripting language: **there is no separate gameplay VM**. ModuCPP is transpiled to C++, that C++ is compiled with the rest of the engine, and the result runs through the same native script runtime as everything else. ModuCPP is *authoring syntax* on top of the engine, not a sandbox sitting next to it.

That gives you a useful pair of properties:

- The friendly, declarative front end (no boilerplate, no manual hook signatures, no manual inspector wiring).
- The native back end (one runtime, one set of data structures, no marshalling cost between "script" and "engine"). Anything you can do in C++ in this codebase — call `std::`, use ImGui directly, read a raw `SceneObject*` — you can do in ModuCPP too.

If your background is **Unity**, think "MonoBehaviour, but compiled into the engine directly." If your background is **Unreal**, think "a leaner equivalent of UObject scripts." If your background is **plain C++**, think of it as a focused front-end that hides the most repetitive parts of writing engine glue.

ModuCPP is intentionally small at the front but wide at the back. The high-level keywords (`add`, `public class`, lifecycle hooks, attributes, `inspector { … }`) are a deliberately constrained set. Once you're past those, the underlying C++ surface — `ctx`, `obj`, every header in `include/`, the entire `std::` library, all of ImGui under `ModuGUI::` — is fully available.

---

## 2. The mental model — how a script becomes engine code

It helps to know the pipeline before you write your first line:

```
   you write           the transpiler           the C++ compiler
  ─────────────       ────────────────         ──────────────────
   MyScript.moducpp ─▶ generated C++       ─▶  native binary
                       (config storage,
                        runtime state,
                        hook entry points,
                        inspector code)
```

What this means in practice:

- **A `public` field is not just metadata.** The transpiler routes it into persisted config storage. The runtime, the inspector, and serialization all know how to find it because it lives in a known shape.
- **A `private` field becomes runtime-only state**, not saved to disk and not shown in the inspector.
- **A hook like `void Begin()` is a recognized name**, not just any method. The transpiler emits a real native entry point and wires it to the runtime.
- **Imports map to includes.** `add ModuEngine;` lowers to `#include "ModuEngineScriptApi.h"`. The set of helpers you can see is exactly the set the headers expose.
- **Anything not recognized as ModuCPP syntax falls through as plain C++.** A free function, a `namespace { … }`, an `std::vector<int>`, a hand-rolled `ImGui::Begin()` call — all valid.

You write the high-level shape. The transpiler handles the boring half. Everything else is just C++.

---

## 3. Your first script

A script that prints the frame rate to its own object's UI label, every frame:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class FPSDisplay : ModuNode
{
    void TickUpdate()
    {
        obj.UILabel = "FPS: " + IntR(ModuEngine.FPS);
    }
}
```

Five things to notice:

1. The two `add …;` lines at the top are the imports. `ModuCPP` is the core; `ModuEngine` is what gives us `ModuEngine.FPS`.
2. `public class FPSDisplay : ModuNode` is the standard declaration form. `ModuNode` is the recommended base.
3. `TickUpdate` is a recognized hook — the runtime calls it every frame.
4. `obj` is the current scene object, made available for free inside the hook. Assigning to `obj.UILabel` sets the UI label on this object.
5. `IntR(x)` rounds to the nearest integer.

Save this as `Assets/Scripts/FPSDisplay.moducpp`, attach it to an object with a UI text component, and you have a working frame-rate readout.

A slightly more realistic version adds configuration through public fields:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class FPSDisplay : ModuNode
{
    public bool clampTo120 = false;
    public string prefix = "FPS: ";

    void Begin()
    {
        if (clampTo120) {
            ctx.SetFPSCap(true, 120.0f);
        }
    }

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        obj.UILabel = prefix + IntR(ModuEngine.FPS);
    }
}
```

This shape — *imports → public fields for configuration → `Begin` for setup → `TickUpdate` for per-frame work* — is the backbone of most real ModuCPP scripts.

---

## 4. Anatomy of a ModuCPP script

A `.moducpp` file is recognized when it contains a class that derives from one of the two script base types:

```cpp
public class MyScript : ModuNode      // preferred for new code
public class MyScript : ModuBehaviour // also supported
```

Both bases share the same hook set. For new gameplay scripts, default to `ModuNode`. `ModuBehaviour` exists because older scripts use it; there is no reason to pick it for greenfield work.

The full set of declaration keywords the transpiler recognizes:

| Keyword | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `add` | Package import at the top of the file. |
| `mark` | Forward-declares a namespace so other scripts can `add` it. Uncommon. |
| `public` | Field is persisted and exposed to the inspector. |
| `private` | Field is runtime-only state. |
| `class` | Standard class declaration. |
| `enum` | Standard enum declaration. Becomes `enum class` in the lowered output. |
| `SubScript` | A nested, serializable data block (see [§21](#21-sub-scripts--structured-repeated-data)). |
| `inspector` | Opens an `inspector { … }` block, the declarative inspector DSL. |
| `to` | Expression-bodied method/hook shorthand (`void Begin() to timer.Start(0.5f);`). |
| `Calc` | Declares a static helper method via `Calc Name(args) to expr;`. Uncommon. |
| `ref` | In/out parameter (mirrors C# `ref`). |
| `each` | Object-list iteration shorthand (`each list.state(true);`). |
| `in`, `then` | Used in the long form of `each`: `each ref item in list then item.State(true);`. |

After the transpile step, ordinary C++ keywords pass through unchanged: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `return`, `static`, `const`, `auto`, `struct`, `namespace`, `using`, `switch`, `case`, `break`, `continue`, `true`, `false`, `nullptr`. You'll use them whenever the high-level surface doesn't have a shorthand.

Member access on the high-level surface uses `.` (not `->`) for the parts ModuCPP wraps (`obj.UILabel`, `obj.UI.Text`, `timer.Start(…)`, `Math.Clamp(…)`). When you reach into the raw `SceneObject` through `obj->name` or `obj->position`, that's normal C++ pointer access — see [§11](#11-raw-scene-object-access-via-obj-).

Helper functions and small types can live outside the class:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

namespace {
    float Smooth(float v) { return v * v * (3.0f - 2.0f * v); }
}

public class MyScript : ModuNode { /* … */ }
```

---

## 5. Imports — bringing in modules

Every script begins with one or more `add …;` lines. Each maps to a single C++ include, so the rule of thumb is **import the smallest surface that solves your problem**:

| Import | What it gives you | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `add ModuCPP;` | Core authoring surface: `ctx`, `obj`, `time`, type aliases, `Math.*`, `IntR*`, `FloatR`, timer helpers, `Config<T>()`/`State<T>()`, `BindSetting`, `SubScript` serializers, `AddLog`, `Color`, the `ModuGUI`/ImGui surface, `obj.UI` typed proxy. | Almost every script. |
| `add ModuEngine;` | Engine helpers: `ModuEngine.FPS`, `audio`/`sprite` facades, `TryMoveRigidbody2D`, `moveTowards`, inspector widgets (`EditFloat`, `EditVec3`, …), project gravity, `warnOnce`. | Gameplay scripts that touch movement, audio, sprites, or extra editor widgets. |
| `add ModuInput;` | Input: `KEY_*` constants, `KeyDown`, `KeyPressed`, `IsSubmitDown`, the `input` facade (`WASD`, `WASDNormalized`, `sprint`, `jump`). | Anything that reads input. |
| `add ModuCPP.Experimental;` | Opt-in: object-ref serialization, UI text targeting, parsing helpers, advanced editor widgets. | Tools, dialogue/menu/interaction scripts, prototype work. Treat as unstable. |
| `add RMeshBuilder;` | Reserved. The import is recognized but the header currently exposes no script-facing helpers. | Don't import it yet. |

A common mistake: adding `add ModuCPP;` and then expecting `input.WASD()` or `ModuEngine.FPS` to be in scope. They are not. Each module is independent, and importing what you actually use is a feature, not a chore — it makes a script's dependencies obvious at the top of the file.

Two niche import forms also work:

- `using PackageName;` — synonym for `add`, accepted for readability.
- `mark NamespaceName;` — forward-declares an empty namespace so another script can `add` it later. Rare; only used when scripts coordinate across files.

## 6. Variables — public fields vs private fields

This is the single most important distinction in ModuCPP. Get it right and most of the rest follows.

**Public fields** are persisted and exposed to the inspector. They are configuration data — what a designer would change without rebuilding.

**Private fields** are runtime-only state. They are not saved, not shown in the inspector, and reset back to their initializer between sessions.

```cpp
public class PatrolGuard : ModuNode
{
    // Configuration. Designers can edit these. They survive a reload.
    public float speed       = 3.0f;
    public float pauseTime   = 1.5f;
    public Vector3 patrolEnd = Vector3(10, 0, 0);

    // Runtime state. Lives only during play.
    private float timer    = 0.0f;
    private bool  movingTo = true;
    private Vector3 origin = Vector3(0, 0, 0);
}
```

A useful test when you can't decide: *"If a designer reloads the scene, should this value reset?"* If yes, it's private. If no, it's public.

Default values are normal:

```cpp
public float speed = 4.0f;
public string label = "Start";
public bool enabled = true;
```

Field types that work as public fields today, drawn from real scripts in the repository:

`bool`, `int`, `float`, `string`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `vec2`, `vec3`, enums, `string[]`, `int[4]`, `int[4][4]`, `string[6]`, `SceneObj[]`, `List<SceneObj*>`, `SubScript[]`, `DialoguePort::DialogueLine[]`.

There is a second authoring family — `Config<T>()` plus `State<T>()` with manual settings binding — used mostly by tool/subsystem scripts. It's covered briefly in [§18](#18-editor-window-scripts). For ordinary gameplay scripts, prefer plain public/private fields.

---

## 7. Types you can use

Most of the types you'll write are familiar. The transpiler rewrites the script-side spelling into the matching C++ type:

| Script-side | Generated C++ |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | `std::string` |
| `vec2`, `Vector2` | `glm::vec2` |
| `vec3`, `Vector3` | `glm::vec3` |
| `SceneObj`, `SceneObject` | `SceneObject` |
| `SceneObj*`, `SceneObject*` | `SceneObject*` |
| `Col` | `SceneObject*` (used in collision hook parameters) |
| `List<T>` | `std::vector<T>` |
| `T[]` | `std::vector<T>` |
| `T[N]` | `std::array<T, N>` |
| `T[R][C]` | `std::array<std::array<T, C>, R>` |

A few common method calls are rewritten for convenience so the script side reads naturally:

- `v.Length()` → `glm::length(v)`
- `a.Dot(b)` → `glm::dot(a, b)`
- `list.IsEmpty()` → `list.empty()`

Enum members can be accessed with `.`; the transpiler rewrites them to `::` when both names start with a capital. So `ConsoleMessageType.Warning` becomes `ConsoleMessageType::Warning` in the lowered code. Write it the friendly way.

There is also a small set of numeric helpers in the core module:

- `IntRD(x)` — round toward negative infinity (floor-like).
- `IntR(x)`  — round to nearest.
- `IntRU(x)` — round toward positive infinity (ceiling-like).
- `FloatR(value, decimals = 2)` — format a float as a string with N decimals.
- `Math.Max`, `Math.Min`, `Math.Clamp`, `Math.Abs`.
- `Color(r, g, b, a = 1.0f)` / `Color(rgb, a = 1.0f)` — build a `vec4` colour.

`IntR` returns a small wrapper type that implicitly stringifies, which is why `"FPS: " + IntR(ModuEngine.FPS)` works as natural string concatenation. The same applies to `FloatR`.

---

## 8. Lifecycle hooks

A "hook" is a method with a recognized name. The transpiler turns it into a native entry point and the runtime calls it at the right time. You do not register, declare a signature, or wire it manually — naming it correctly is enough.

The runtime-side hooks:

| Hook | When it fires | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `void Begin()` | Once, before the first update. | Setup: start timers, cache references, initialize state, ensure required components. |
| `void TickUpdate()` | Every frame. (Variants: `TickUpdate(float dt)`, `TickUpdate(ScriptContext& ctx, float dt)`.) | The main per-frame body — input, movement, UI updates, timers. |
| `void Update()` | Every frame, older-style. | Supported for back-compat. Prefer `TickUpdate` for new scripts. |
| `void Spec()` | When the engine runs the script in "spec mode". | Runtime-spec behavior. Most scripts don't need this. |
| `void TestEditor()` | When the engine runs the script in editor test mode. | Editor-side tests. Most scripts don't need this. |

The editor-side hooks:

| Hook | When it fires | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `void Script_OnInspector()` | When the inspector is drawn for this script. | Fully manual inspector drawing. Skip unless the declarative form isn't enough. |
| `void RenderEditorWindow()` | When this script is a standalone editor-window tool. | Drawing the contents of an editor window. |
| `void ExitRenderEditorWindow()` | When the same editor window closes. | Cleanup for an editor window. |

The collision hooks (`OnCollideEnter` / `OnCollideHold` / `OnCollideExit`) get their own section — see [§9](#9-collision-hooks).

Each of the inspector/editor hooks also accepts an explicit `(ScriptContext& ctx)` overload if you want it.

You don't have to declare `ScriptContext& ctx` to use `ctx`. The transpiler auto-injects it into hook bodies through a small prelude. Same for `obj` (the current object) and `dt` (the frame delta in tick-style hooks). You can still take them as parameters if you prefer to be explicit.

**What is *not* a hook:** `OnEnable`, `OnDisable`, `OnDestroy`, `OnTriggerEnter`, `Awake`, `Start` (use `Begin`), and the Unity-style update variants like `FixedUpdate` or `LateUpdate`. The recognized hook list above is exhaustive. If you write a method with one of those names, it just becomes a regular function that nothing calls.

A complete minimal lifecycle example:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class Heartbeat : ModuNode
{
    public float interval = 1.0f;
    private float timer   = 0.0f;
    private int   beats   = 0;

    void Begin()
    {
        timer.Start(interval);
        AddLog("Heartbeat ready", Type.Info);
    }

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        if (!timer.Ready()) return;
        beats = beats + 1;
        AddLog("Beat " + IntR(beats));
    }
}
```

---

## 9. Collision hooks

When two physics objects collide, the runtime calls these on any script attached to either side:

| Hook | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| `void OnCollideEnter(Col other)` | The frame a new collision begins. |
| `void OnCollideHold(Col other)` | Every ~2 seconds while still in contact (configurable per script — see below). |
| `void OnCollideExit(Col other)` | The frame the collision ends. |

`Col` is an alias for `SceneObject*` — it's just a pointer to the other object. The name is a shorthand for "collider" but there's no per-hit struct with normals, depth, or impact velocity. If you need those, raycast or query the physics state through `ctx` separately.

The `OnCollideHold` interval is **2.0 seconds by default**. To change it on a per-script basis, add a trailing float to the parameter list:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class GateLock : ModuNode
{
    [ObjectList] public string[] toEnable;

    void OnCollideEnter(Col other)
    {
        AddLog("Touched by " + other->name, Type.Info);
    }

    // Fires every 3.5 seconds while contact is held.
    void OnCollideHold(Col other 3.5f)
    {
        each toEnable.state(true);
    }

    void OnCollideExit(Col other)
    {
        each toEnable.state(false);
    }
}
```

That trailing `3.5f` looks unusual but it's the documented per-script firing interval, not a default argument.

Collision hooks do not auto-inject `dt`. They only auto-inject `ctx` (so `ctx.AddConsoleMessage(…)` and the other engine calls still work inside them). The collision target object is `other`.

For collision to fire at all, both objects need physics components — typically a `Rigidbody2D` and a `Collider2D` (or their 3D counterparts) — on at least one side. If a hook never runs, the object is missing physics, not the script is broken.

---

## 10. The built-ins available inside a hook

Inside any lifecycle hook, the following names are already in scope. You don't import them, declare them, or pass them around.

### `ctx` — the script context

`ctx` is your bridge to the engine. It is the most-used identifier in any non-trivial script. A short list of the categories of things it can do:

- **Current object**: `ctx.object`, `ctx.MarkDirty()`, `ctx.IsObjectEnabled(…)`, `ctx.SetObjectEnabled(…)`, `ctx.FindObjectByName(…)`, `ctx.FindObjectById(…)`, `ctx.ResolveObjectRef(…)`.
- **Iteration**: `ctx.GetSceneObjectCount()`, `ctx.GetSceneObjectIdAt(i)`, `ctx.GetSelectedObjectId()`.
- **Tag/Layer**: `ctx.GetTag()`, `ctx.SetTag(s)`, `ctx.HasTag(s)`, `ctx.GetLayer()`, `ctx.SetLayer(n)`, `ctx.IsInLayer(n)`.
- **Transform**: `ctx.SetPosition`, `ctx.SetPosition2D`, `ctx.SetRotation`, `ctx.SetScale`.
- **Input** (whether or not `ModuInput` is imported): `ctx.GetMoveInputWASD`, `ctx.IsSprintDown`, `ctx.IsJumpDown`, `ctx.IsKeyDown`, `ctx.IsKeyPressed`, `ctx.ApplyMouseLook`.
- **Physics 3D**: `ctx.HasRigidbody`, `ctx.EnsureRigidbody(useGravity=true, kinematic=false)`, `ctx.EnsureCapsuleCollider(height, radius)`, `ctx.SetRigidbodyVelocity`, `ctx.GetRigidbodyVelocity`, `ctx.AddRigidbodyVelocity`, `ctx.AddRigidbodyForce`, `ctx.AddRigidbodyImpulse`, `ctx.AddRigidbodyTorque`, `ctx.AddRigidbodyAngularImpulse`, `ctx.SetRigidbodyAngularVelocity`, `ctx.GetRigidbodyAngularVelocity`, `ctx.SetRigidbodyYaw`, `ctx.SetRigidbodyRotation`, `ctx.TeleportRigidbody(pos, rotDeg)`, `ctx.RaycastClosest`, `ctx.RaycastClosestDetailed`.
- **Physics 2D**: `ctx.HasRigidbody2D`, `ctx.SetRigidbody2DVelocity`, `ctx.GetRigidbody2DVelocity`.
- **Other objects** (operate on a target by id, not the current one): `ctx.SetObjectRigidbodyVelocity`, `ctx.GetObjectRigidbodyVelocity`, `ctx.AddObjectRigidbodyImpulse`, `ctx.TeleportObjectRigidbody`.
- **Gravity**: `ctx.GetProjectGravityScale`, `ctx.SetProjectGravityScale(s)`.
- **UI**: `ctx.SetUILabel`, `ctx.SetUIColor`, `ctx.SetUIInteractable`, `ctx.IsUIButtonPressed`, `ctx.IsUIHovered`, `ctx.IsUIActive`, `ctx.GetUISliderValue`, `ctx.SetUISliderValue`, `ctx.SetUISliderRange`, `ctx.SetUISliderStyle`, `ctx.SetUIButtonStyle`, `ctx.SetUIStylePreset`, `ctx.RegisterUIStylePreset`, `ctx.SetUITextScale`, `ctx.GetUITextScale`, `ctx.SetFPSCap`.
- **Sprite/animation**: `ctx.GetSpriteClipIndex`, `ctx.SetSpriteClipIndex`, `ctx.SetSpriteClipName`, `ctx.GetSpriteClipName`, `ctx.GetSpriteClipCount`, `ctx.GetSpriteClipNameAt`, `ctx.SetSpriteAlpha`, `ctx.GetSpriteAlpha`, `ctx.FadeSpriteAlpha(target, duration, dt)`, `ctx.FadeSpriteToClipIndex(idx, fadeOut, fadeIn, dt)`, `ctx.FadeSpriteToClipName`, `ctx.PlayAnimation`, `ctx.StopAnimation`, `ctx.PauseAnimation`, `ctx.ReverseAnimation`, `ctx.SetAnimationLoop`, `ctx.IsAnimationPlaying`, `ctx.SetAnimationPlaySpeed`, `ctx.SetAnimationPlayOnAwake`, `ctx.SetAnimationTime`, `ctx.GetAnimationTime`.
- **Audio**: `ctx.HasAudioSource`, `ctx.PlayAudio`, `ctx.StopAudio`, `ctx.PlayAudioOneShot`, `ctx.SetAudioVolume`, `ctx.SetAudioLoop`, `ctx.SetAudioClip`.
- **Settings & files**: `ctx.GetSetting`, `ctx.SetSetting`, `ctx.AutoSetting`, `ctx.SaveAutoSettings`, `ctx.ReadFileText`, `ctx.WriteFileText`, `ctx.DeleteFile`, `ctx.ListFiles`, `ctx.SearchFiles`, `ctx.SaveProject`, `ctx.GetProgramRootPath`, `ctx.GetEngineDocsRootPath`.
- **HTTP**: `ctx.HttpPost`, `ctx.StartHttpPost`, `ctx.PollHttpPost`, `ctx.CancelHttpPost`.
- **Console**: `ctx.AddConsoleMessage("…", ConsoleMessageType::Info)`. There is also a friendlier free-function form — `AddLog(message, Type.Info)` — covered below.

The full member list lives in [api/type-scriptcontext.md](api/type-scriptcontext.md). The names above cover what 90% of scripts ever need.

### `obj` — the current scene object

`obj` is a small facade around `ctx.object`. You can:

- Bool-check it: `if (!obj) return;`
- Pointer-style read fields: `obj->name`, `obj->id`, `obj->position`, `obj->rotation`. See [§11](#11-raw-scene-object-access-via-obj-) for the full surface.
- Use the typed UI proxy: `obj.UI.Text`, `obj.UI.Position`, `obj.UI.OnClick(…)`. See [§15](#15-the-typed-ui-proxy--objui).
- Assign UI labels directly with the legacy shorthand: `obj.UILabel = "Hello";`

If a hook acts on the object the script is attached to, prefer `obj` over `ctx.object`.

### `dt` — frame delta time

A `float` representing the seconds since the last frame, available inside update-style hooks. Use it for any time-scaled work:

```cpp
void TickUpdate()
{
    pos = pos + velocity * dt;
}
```

You can also reach it via `time.deltaTime` from the `ModuCPP` core, or via the free function `DeltaTime()`.

### `AddLog` and `Type` — the console shorthand

The friendly form of `ctx.AddConsoleMessage`:

```cpp
AddLog("started");                       // Info by default
AddLog("low on health", Type.Warning);
AddLog("save failed", Type.Error);
AddLog("level loaded", Type.Success);
```

`Type.Info`, `Type.Warning`, `Type.Error`, `Type.Success` are inline constants that map to `ConsoleMessageType` values. The `Type.X` syntax is rewritten to `Type::X` automatically.

### `input` — the input facade (requires `add ModuInput;`)

Convenient high-level input:

- `input.WASD()` — raw `Vector2` from the WASD keys.
- `input.WASDNormalized()` — unit-length when any key is held; zero when none. **Use this** for movement so diagonals are not faster.
- `input.sprint()` — true while sprint (Shift) is held.
- `input.jump()` — true while jump is held. This is *not* an edge — see [§16](#16-input) for a one-shot jump.

### `audio` and `sprite` — component facades (require `add ModuEngine;`)

Tiny wrappers around the corresponding components on the current object:

- `audio.HasSource()`, `audio.PlayOneShot(path, volumeScale)`, `audio.Play()`, `audio.Stop()`.
- `sprite.HasClips()`, `sprite.ClipCount()`, `sprite.ClipIndex()`, `sprite.SetClip(index)`, `sprite.SetClip(name)`, `sprite.ClipNameAt(index)`.

Both fail silently when the component is missing. Guard with the matching `Has*` check if the object might not have one.

### `ModuEngine` — the engine facade

A namespaced value with engine-scope info such as `ModuEngine.FPS`.

### `timer` — the timer shorthand

Not really a separate object — it's a rewrite around a `float` field you declared. See [§12](#12-timers-and-the-to--each-shorthand).

## 11. Raw scene-object access via `obj->`

`obj` implicitly converts to a `SceneObject*`, so you can dereference straight through with `obj->fieldName`. Same goes for `ctx.object->fieldName`, `myRef->fieldName` where `myRef` is a `SceneObj*`, or `other->fieldName` inside a collision hook.

This is your escape hatch when the high-level facades don't cover a case. Use it carefully — the high-level surface exists for a reason — but know it's there.

### Identity / hierarchy

```cpp
obj->name        // std::string
obj->id          // int
obj->tag         // std::string ("Untagged" by default)
obj->layer       // int
obj->parentId    // int, -1 if root
obj->childIds    // std::vector<int>
obj->enabled     // bool; toggle for "active in hierarchy"
```

### Transform

```cpp
obj->position    // vec3 world-space
obj->rotation    // vec3 (Euler, degrees)
obj->scale       // vec3
obj->localPosition / obj->localRotation / obj->localScale
```

**Important:** if the object has a physics rigidbody, direct writes to `obj->position` bypass the physics sync and can put the visual and the simulation out of step. Prefer `ctx.SetPosition(vec3)` or `ctx.TeleportRigidbody(pos, rotDeg)` for physics-driven objects.

### Component presence flags

Each major component family has a `bool has…` flag plus a matching struct. Read the flag first, then read the struct fields if it's true:

```
hasRigidbody          hasRigidbody2D
hasCollider           hasCollider2D
hasAudioSource        hasVideoPlayer
hasAnimation          hasSkeletalAnimation
hasLight              hasLight2D
hasCamera             hasCameraFollow2D
hasUI                 hasRenderer
hasParticleSystem2D   hasParallaxLayer2D
hasReverbZone         hasShadowCaster2D
hasPlayerController   hasAIAgent
hasRig25DRoot         hasRig25DNode
hasPostFX             hasReflectionCast
hasGroundBakedType    hasObsticleObject
```

A typical guard:

```cpp
if (!obj->hasRigidbody2D) {
    warnMissingComponentOnce(ctx, warnedNoRb, "Mover2D", "Rigidbody2D");
    return;
}
```

### Rendering and material

```cpp
obj->meshPath               // std::string
obj->materialPath           // std::string
obj->albedoTexturePath
obj->normalMapPath
obj->shaderPackPath
obj->useOverlay             // bool
```

### Free helpers that take a `SceneObject*`

These come from `add ModuCPP;` and let you write less code than `ctx.…` calls when the target is something other than `ctx.object`:

- `CurrentObject()` — `SceneObj` for `ctx.object`.
- `ResolveObject(ref)` / `SmartResolveRef(ref)` — turn an object name or `"Object.ID-N"` string into a `SceneObject*`.
- `HasUI(obj)` — UI-component check.
- `SetActive(obj, active)` — toggles `obj->enabled` and dirties context.
- `PlaySound(objectRef, volumeScale = 1.0f)` — plays the named object's audio source.
- `PlaySoundClip(clipPath, volumeScale = 1.0f)` — plays a clip directly.

A few more free shorthands that operate on the current object (no `ctx.` prefix needed): `SetPosition`, `SetRotation`, `SetScale`, `MarkDirty`, `DeltaTime`, `SetFPSCap`, `GetSetting`/`SetSetting` and friends, `SaveAutoSettings`.

---

## 12. Timers and the `to` / `each` shorthand

ModuCPP has a tiny built-in timer pattern that covers most "do something every N seconds" needs.

Declare a private `float` for the accumulator, start it in `Begin`, then early-return in `TickUpdate` while it isn't ready:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class PulseLogger : ModuNode
{
    public float interval = 0.5f;
    private float timer   = 0.0f;

    void Begin() to timer.Start(interval);

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        if (!timer.Ready()) return;
        AddLog("Pulse");
    }
}
```

The shorthand is a pair of rewrites on **any `float` field** (the name `timer` is just a convention):

- `<field>.Start(interval)` → `::ModuCPP::StartTimer(<field>, interval)`
- `<field>.Ready()`         → `::ModuCPP::TimerReady(<field>)`
- `<field>.Ready(interval)` → `::ModuCPP::TimerReady(<field>, interval)`

`TimerReady` advances by the current frame delta on its own. After it returns true, it rolls into the next interval automatically, so the example above pulses once every half-second indefinitely. For a one-shot, set a private `bool fired` and gate on it.

### The `to` keyword

`to` is an expression-bodied method shorthand. Any method whose entire body is a single expression can use it:

```cpp
void Begin() to timer.Start(interval);          // void → expression as-is
bool IsReady() to timer.Ready;                  // non-void → emits `return …;`
int  ClampFrame(int f) to Math.Clamp(f, 0, 3);  // non-void → emits `return …;`
```

It's a readability tool. Don't reach for it in branching or multi-statement code — write a normal body instead.

### The `each` shorthand for object lists

For persisted object-list fields, you can enable or disable every referenced object in one line:

```cpp
[ObjectList] public string[] toEnable;
[ObjectList] public string[] toDisable;

void Begin()
{
    each toEnable.state(true);
    each toDisable.state(false);
}
```

Equivalent to resolving each ref against the scene and calling `SetObjectEnabled`. Use it for menus and event-triggered batches.

There is a longer form that lets you name the loop variable, although the short form covers most needs:

```cpp
each ref item in toEnable then item.State(true);
```

### The `Calc` keyword

`Calc Name(args) to expr;` declares a static helper method. Rare — most helpers go in `namespace { … }` instead — but available:

```cpp
Calc int DoubleIt(int x) to x * 2;
```

---

## 13. The inspector — three ways to expose data

Public fields are the contract between a script and a designer. ModuCPP gives you three escalating ways to draw them, and the right pick depends on how much control you need.

### A) Automatic — declare and you're done

If you don't need control over labels, ordering, or sections, just declare public fields and stop.

```cpp
public class Mover : ModuNode
{
    public float speed = 3.0f;
    public bool  loop  = true;
}
```

You get a default inspector with both fields, in the order they were declared.

### B) Attributes — tweak each field where it lives

When you want a slider, a header, a tooltip, or a different widget for an array, annotate the field. Attributes live on the line above the field:

```cpp
public class Patroller : ModuNode
{
    [Header("Speed")]
    [Slider(0.0f, 10.0f)]
    public float speed = 3.0f;

    [Header("Targets")]
    [ObjectList]
    public string[] waypoints;

    [Separator]
    [Header("Audio")]
    [SoundSet("Footsteps")]
    public string[] footstepSounds;
}
```

Recognized attributes:

| Attribute | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `[Header("Title")]` | Insert a heading and visual separator before the field. |
| `[Slider(min, max)]` | Slider widget. Works on `float`, `int`, `vec3`. |
| `[ObjectRef]` | A `string` field becomes a single object-reference picker. |
| `[ObjectList]` | A `string[]` becomes an object-reference list. |
| `[DialogueLines]` | Mark an array as dialogue data. |
| `[ClipGridPair]` | For an `int[4]` followed by `int[4][4]` — animation grid. |
| `[Separator]` | Visual separator before the field. |
| `[SoundSet("Label")]` | Sound-set editor on a `string[]`. |
| `@range(min, max)` | Range metadata for numeric auto inspectors. |
| `@step(value)` | Drag-step metadata for numeric auto inspectors. |

`[ObjectRef]` fields also enable a truthiness shortcut: `if (myRef)` becomes `if (!myRef.empty())` under the hood, so you can write the natural form.

### C) The declarative `inspector { … }` block

When you want tabs, sections, runtime status panels, or a fully custom layout, open an `inspector { … }` block on the class. This is the canonical "rich inspector" form and it covers almost all custom UIs without dropping into manual drawing.

```cpp
public class Patroller : ModuNode
{
    public float speed = 3.0f;
    public string[] waypoints;
    private int currentWaypoint = 0;

    inspector
    {
        Tabs
        {
            Tab("Config")
            {
                Header("Movement");
                AutoFields(speed);
                Header("Path");
                ObjectList("Waypoints", waypoints);
            }
            Tab("Runtime")
            {
                Run(ModuGUI::TextDisabled("Current waypoint: %d", currentWaypoint));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`AutoFields(...)` is a convenience — it draws the named *persisted public fields on this class* using their normal widgets. It does not see private fields, `Config<T>()` storage, or values from other classes; use the explicit `Slider`/`String`/`Number`/`ObjectRef`/etc. statements for those.

`Run(...)` is the escape hatch. Whatever you put inside is run when the inspector draws, so it can show ModuGUI/ImGui text, run migrations, or call any other helper.

### D) Fully manual — `Script_OnInspector()`

If even the DSL is not enough (which is rare), implement `void Script_OnInspector()` and draw the entire panel yourself with the engine's editor helpers. This is the path used by tool/subsystem scripts that build their own widgets from scratch. For ordinary gameplay scripts, you should not need this.

---

## 14. The `inspector { … }` DSL reference

The DSL is statement-oriented. Statements end with a semicolon; containers use braces.

### Containers (open with `{ … }`)

- `Tabs { … }` — a tab bar.
- `Tab(title) { … }` — one tab inside `Tabs`.
- `Section(title) { … }` — a labelled section.
- `Group { … }`, `Group(title) { … }` — a logical group.
- `Foldout(title) { … }` — collapsible section.

### Field statements (each ends with `;`)

- Storage: `Config(Type, varName);`, `AutoSave(configVar);`, `Save(configVar);`.
- Layout: `Header(title);`, `Separator();`.
- Logic escape hatch: `Run(expression);` — runs the expression when the inspector draws.

### Widget statements

Each accepts both an unlabelled form and a labelled form:

- `Toggle(value);` / `Toggle(label, value);`
- `Slider(value, min, max);` / `Slider(label, value, min, max);`
- `Number(value);` / `Number(label, value);`
- `String(value);` / `String(label, value);`
- `Enum(value);` / `Enum(label, value);`
- `ObjectRef(value);` / `ObjectRef(label, value);`
- `ObjectList(value);` / `ObjectList(label, value);`
- `AudioClip(value);` / `AudioClip(label, value);`
- `DialogueLines(lines);` / `DialogueLines(label, lines);`
- `TextEffectFlags(effect);` / `TextEffectFlags(label, effect);`
- `InteractionOptions(options);` / `InteractionOptions(label, options);`
- `MenuActions(refs, actions);` / `MenuActions(label, refs, actions);`
- `ClipGrid(idleClips, walkClips);`
- `SoundSet(label, sounds);`
- `AutoFields(field1, field2, …);` — auto-draw persisted public fields by name.

### Runtime-status helpers

These are no-arg widgets that print the current runtime state of a system. They are intended for the "Runtime" tab of a multi-tab inspector:

- `RuntimeDialogueStatus();`
- `RuntimeInteractableStatus();`
- `RuntimeMenuStatus();`

---

## 15. The typed UI proxy — `obj.UI.*`

For objects that have a UI component, `obj.UI` is a typed proxy that lets you read and write UI fields with natural assignments and register input callbacks with lambdas. It comes with `add ModuCPP;`.

### Existence check

```cpp
if (!obj.UI.Exists) return;
if (obj.UI.IsText)   { /* … */ }
if (obj.UI.IsButton) { /* … */ }
if (obj.UI.IsSlider) { /* … */ }
if (obj.UI.IsImage)  { /* … */ }
```

### Generic properties (read and write)

These work on any UI element:

| Property | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `obj.UI.Text` | `string` |
| `obj.UI.FontSize` | `float` |
| `obj.UI.Position` | `vec2` |
| `obj.UI.Size` | `vec2` |
| `obj.UI.Rotation` | `float` (degrees) |
| `obj.UI.Scale` | `vec2` |
| `obj.UI.Color` | `vec4` |
| `obj.UI.TextColor` | `vec4` |
| `obj.UI.BackgroundColor` | `vec4` |
| `obj.UI.Tint` | `vec4` |
| `obj.UI.Alpha` | `float` (clamped 0…1) |
| `obj.UI.Visible` | `bool` (proxy for `enabled`) |
| `obj.UI.Enabled` | `bool` (same as `Visible`) |
| `obj.UI.Interactable` | `bool` |
| `obj.UI.Layer` | `int` |
| `obj.UI.SortingOrder` (alias `obj.UI.Order`) | `int` |
| `obj.UI.Pivot` | `vec2` (clamped 0…1) |
| `obj.UI.Anchor` | `int` (UIAnchor cast) |

Plus two convenience methods:

- `obj.UI.SetFront()` — sortingOrder = 1000.
- `obj.UI.SetBack()`  — sortingOrder = -1000.

### Typed sub-proxies

For widgets that have widget-specific fields:

```cpp
// Buttons
obj.UI.Button.Text;
obj.UI.Button.Enabled;
obj.UI.Button.Interactable;

// Sliders
obj.UI.Slider.Label;
obj.UI.Slider.Value;
obj.UI.Slider.Min;
obj.UI.Slider.Max;
obj.UI.Slider.FillColor;
obj.UI.Slider.BackgroundColor;
obj.UI.Slider.TextColor;
obj.UI.Slider.TextSize;

// Images
obj.UI.Image.Texture;   // string path
obj.UI.Image.Tint;      // vec4
```

`obj.UI.Toggle` and `obj.UI.Input` exist as stubs. They warn once and return defaults — the engine doesn't have those UI types yet. Treat them as reserved.

### Event callbacks (lambdas)

Use the arrow lambda syntax (covered in [§22](#22-other-recognized-syntax)):

```cpp
void Begin()
{
    obj.UI.OnClick(() => {
        AddLog("button clicked");
    });

    obj.UI.OnHover(() => { AddLog("hover in"); });
    obj.UI.OnUnhover(() => { AddLog("hover out"); });

    obj.UI.Slider.OnValueChanged((float v) => {
        AddLog("slider: " + FloatR(v));
    });
}
```

Available events: `OnClick`, `OnUnclick`, `OnPress`, `OnRelease`, `OnHover`, `OnUnhover` (plus slider/toggle/input-specific ones where the widget supports it).

### UI proxies on `[ObjectRef]` fields

If you have an `[ObjectRef] public string someUiTarget;`, you can drive that other object's UI through the same proxy form:

```cpp
[ObjectRef] public string statusLabel;

void TickUpdate()
{
    statusLabel.UI.Text = "FPS: " + IntR(ModuEngine.FPS);
}
```

The transpiler rewrites these into the appropriate engine helpers automatically.

---

## 16. Input

Input lives in `ModuInput`. There are two ergonomic styles.

### High-level facade (`input.*`) — for movement and standard actions

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuInput;

public class Walker : ModuNode
{
    public float speed = 4.0f;

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        Vector2 move = input.WASDNormalized();
        ctx.SetPosition2D(Vector2(obj->position.x, obj->position.y) + move * speed * dt);
    }
}
```

| Call | Returns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input.WASD()` | `Vector2` | Raw component-summed direction. Diagonals are longer than 1. |
| `input.WASDNormalized()` | `Vector2` | Unit length when held, zero when idle. Use this for movement. |
| `input.sprint()` | `bool` | True while Shift is held. |
| `input.jump()` | `bool` | True while Space is held. **Held state, not an edge.** |

### Key-level polling — for one-shots and bindings

For "press once" behaviour you need either `KeyPressed` (edge-triggered) or a manual previous-frame check:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuInput;

public class JumpOnce : ModuNode
{
    public float jumpImpulse = 5.0f;
    private bool prevJump    = false;

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        bool nowJump = input.jump();
        bool pressed = nowJump && !prevJump;
        if (pressed) {
            ctx.AddRigidbodyImpulse(Vector3(0, jumpImpulse, 0));
        }
        prevJump = nowJump;
    }
}
```

Recognized key constants: `KEY_W`, `KEY_A`, `KEY_S`, `KEY_D`, `KEY_E`, `KEY_UP`, `KEY_DOWN`, `KEY_LEFT`, `KEY_RIGHT`, `KEY_SHIFT_LEFT`, `KEY_SHIFT_RIGHT`, `KEY_SPACE`, `KEY_ENTER`, `KEY_KP_ENTER`.

Free functions: `KeyDown(key)`, `KeyPressed(key)`, `IsRuntimeKeyDown(glfwKey, imguiKey)`, `IsSubmitDown()`.

---

## 17. Engine helpers (`ModuEngine`)

`add ModuEngine;` covers the bulk of "I want a thing the engine already does." Highlights:

### Movement (free functions on `ctx`)

- `TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, targetVelocity, acceleration, drag, dt[, outVelocity])` — accelerates and drags toward a target velocity. Fails silently if there is no `Rigidbody2D` on the object.
- `moveRigidbody2D(ctx, targetVelocity, acceleration, drag, dt)` — same shape, no `out` velocity.
- `movePosition2D(ctx, delta)` — direct 2D position offset.
- `moveTowards(current, target, maxDelta)` — clamp a step toward a target.
- `EnsureRigidbody(useGravity = true, kinematic = false)` — create one if missing.
- `EnsureCapsuleCollider(height, radius)` — same for a capsule collider.

### Audio facade

- `audio.HasSource()`, `audio.PlayOneShot(path, volumeScale)`, `audio.Play()`, `audio.Stop()`.

### Sprite facade

- `sprite.HasClips()`, `sprite.ClipCount()`, `sprite.ClipIndex()`, `sprite.SetClip(…)`, `sprite.ClipNameAt(index)`.

### Inspector / editor widgets

For use inside `Script_OnInspector` and editor windows:

- `EditFloat(label, value, speed, min, max, format, keyOverride)`
- `EditInt(label, value, step, stepFast, keyOverride)`
- `EditBool(label, value, keyOverride)`
- `EditVec3(label, value, …)`
- `EditString(label, value, capacity, keyOverride, flags, multiline, multilineHeight)`
- `EditClipSelector(label, clipIndex)`
- `EditDirectionalClipGrid(idleClips, walkClips)`
- `EditSoundSet(heading, sounds, itemPrefix)`

### Engine values

- `ModuEngine.FPS` — current frame rate.
- `GetProjectGravityScale()`, `SetProjectGravityScale(scale)`.

### Warnings (avoid log spam)

- `warnOnce(ctx, alreadyWarned, message, type)` — log a one-time warning gated by a `bool`.
- `warnMissingComponentOnce(ctx, alreadyWarned, scriptName, componentName)` — the same pattern, specialized for missing components.

---

## 18. Editor-window scripts

For scripts that act as standalone editor tools rather than scene components, two extra hooks come into play:

- `void RenderEditorWindow()` — draw the window each frame the editor opens it.
- `void ExitRenderEditorWindow()` — cleanup when the window closes.

Tool scripts often also use the `Config<T>()` + `State<T>()` storage pattern instead of public/private fields, because the script isn't attached to a scene object:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class MyTool : ModuNode
{
    inspector
    {
        Config(MyToolConfig, config);
        AutoSave(config);
        // … widgets that read/write fields on `config` …
    }

    void RenderEditorWindow()
    {
        auto& config = Config<MyToolConfig>();
        // draw the tool window using ModuGUI / EditFloat / etc.
    }
}
```

A few rules for `Config<T>()` if you go down this path:

- It only allocates storage. To actually persist values, call `BindSetting` / `BindArray` / `BindArray2D` from the `ModuCPP` module.
- Re-bind in every hook that *reads* the config, not just the inspector hook, or you will see stale data at runtime.
- After mutating settings manually, call `ctx.SaveAutoSettings()` to flush.

For ordinary gameplay scripts, you do not need any of this. Use public/private fields.

---

## 19. The editor UI surface — `ModuGUI` / ImGui

Editor-window scripts and manual inspectors draw their UI with the engine's bundled ImGui. ModuCPP exposes the entire ImGui API under two interchangeable names:

- `ModuGUI::Whatever(…)` — preferred.
- `ImGui::Whatever(…)`   — same function, accepted everywhere.

They are literally aliases. Use either prefix; pick one and be consistent within a file.

There is one Modularity-specific helper on top of ImGui:

- `ModuGUI::SubsectionFoldout(label, flags = 0)` — a styled `TreeNodeEx` used by `inspector Foldout { … }` and `EditDirectionalClipGrid`.

Everything else — `Begin`, `End`, `Text`, `TextWrapped`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `InputText`, `SliderFloat`, `Combo`, `BeginChild`/`EndChild`, `BeginTabBar`, `BeginTable`, `BeginPopup`, drag-drop, style stacks, ID stacks — is the ImGui surface you already know.

The supporting ImGui types and macros are also in scope:

| Name | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `ImVec2(x, y)` | 2-float position/size constructor. |
| `ImVec4(r, g, b, a)` | 4-float colour constructor. |
| `IM_ARRAYSIZE(arr)` | Array length macro. |
| `ImGuiInputTextFlags_*` | Input text flags (`EnterReturnsTrue`, `Password`, `ReadOnly`, …). |
| `ImGuiTreeNodeFlags_*`, `ImGuiTableFlags_*`, `ImGuiWindowFlags_*`, `ImGuiChildFlags_*`, `ImGuiSelectableFlags_*` | Widget flag enums. |
| `ImGuiCol_*` | Colour slot enum for `PushStyleColor`. |
| `ImGuiStyleVar_*` | Style variable enum for `PushStyleVar`. |
| `ImGuiKey_*` | Key codes used by `ctx.IsKeyDown(int glfwKey, ImGuiKey imguiKey)`. |

A short editor-window example showing common ModuGUI patterns:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class TinyTool : ModuNode
{
    void RenderEditorWindow()
    {
        ModuGUI::TextUnformatted("Quick controls");
        ModuGUI::Separator();

        static float speed = 1.0f;
        ModuGUI::SliderFloat("Speed", &speed, 0.0f, 10.0f);

        static bool showAdvanced = false;
        ModuGUI::Checkbox("Show advanced", &showAdvanced);

        if (showAdvanced) {
            if (ModuGUI::BeginChild("##adv", ImVec2(0, 120), true)) {
                ModuGUI::TextDisabled("Advanced options…");
            }
            ModuGUI::EndChild();
        }

        if (ModuGUI::Button("Reset", ImVec2(80, 0))) {
            speed = 1.0f;
        }
    }
}
```

For the full ImGui API, treat the upstream ImGui reference as authoritative — every function is callable through `ModuGUI::`.

---

## 20. Coroutines — `IEnum`

For "do something across many frames" work, ModuCPP exposes a small coroutine-style helper layer built on free functions plus a few macros:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

// A coroutine is just a free function taking (ctx, dt).
IEnum void FadeOut(ScriptContext& ctx, float dt)
{
    static float alpha = 1.0f;
    alpha -= dt * 0.5f;
    ctx.SetSpriteAlpha(alpha);
    if (alpha <= 0.0f) {
        IEnum_Stop(FadeOut);   // request that the runtime drop it
    }
}

public class FadeOnClick : ModuNode
{
    void Begin()
    {
        IEnum_Start(FadeOut);
    }
}
```

The relevant pieces:

- `IEnum` — empty marker macro on the function declaration; documents intent.
- `IEnum_Start(fn)` → `ctx.StartIEnum(fn)` — begin running.
- `IEnum_Stop(fn)`  → `ctx.StopIEnum(fn)`  — stop running.
- `IEnum_Ensure(fn)` → `ctx.EnsureIEnum(fn)` — start if not already running.
- `ctx.IsIEnumRunning(fn)`, `ctx.StopAllIEnums()` — query and bulk-stop.

The function signature is fixed: `void fn(ScriptContext&, float dt)`. The runtime calls it every frame until it's stopped.

---

## 21. Sub-scripts — structured repeated data

When you need a list of structured items (a menu of options, an interaction with multiple branches, a wave of enemies with per-wave settings), use `SubScript`. It declares a named, serializable record type that can be used as a field type:

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class MainMenuController : ModuNode
{
    SubScript MenuAction
    {
        public SceneObj[] enable;
        public SceneObj[] disable;
    };

    public MenuAction[] actions;

    void Begin()
    {
        // actions is a normal array; each element has `enable` and `disable` lists.
    }
}
```

This is much better than flattening into parallel arrays. The inspector understands `SubScript[]` and gives you a per-entry editor, and the values serialize as one structured block.

Helpers (in the `ModuCPP` module):

- `SerializeSubScript(value)`, `DeserializeSubScript<T>(encoded)`
- `SerializeSubScriptArray(values)`, `DeserializeSubScriptArray<T>(encoded)`
- `EditSubScript(label, value)`, `EditSubScriptArray(label, values)` — for manual inspector drawing.

---

## 22. Other recognized syntax

A handful of small syntactic conveniences that don't fit cleanly into the sections above.

### Arrow lambdas — `(args) => { body }`

The transpiler rewrites this into `[&](args) { body }`, so lambdas have natural capture-by-reference semantics:

```cpp
obj.UI.OnClick(() => { AddLog("click"); });
obj.UI.Slider.OnValueChanged((float v) => { AddLog(FloatR(v)); });
```

### `$"…"` strings — newline normalization only

`$` in front of a string literal lets the string contain raw newlines, which are normalized to `\n` for the compiler:

```cpp
public string greeting = $"Hello,
this is a multi-line greeting.";
```

**Important:** `$` strings do *not* do `{var}` interpolation, despite looking like C#. If you want a value spliced in, concatenate it:

```cpp
AddLog("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

### `mark Foo;` — namespace forward-declaration

Declares an empty `namespace Foo {}` so that another script can `add Foo;` and see it. Rare; only needed when scripts coordinate across files.

### `Calc Name(args) to expr;` — static helper

A one-line static-method declaration. Most helpers go in `namespace { … }` instead, but `Calc` is available if you want the shorter form.

### Standard library passthrough

ModuCPP doesn't restrict `std::`. The core script include transitively brings in:

`<algorithm>`, `<array>`, `<cmath>`, `<cctype>`, `<cstdio>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<cfloat>`, `<limits>`, `<regex>`, `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<unordered_set>`, `<typeinfo>`, `<functional>`.

So the following are available without an extra `#include` line:

- Strings: `std::string`, `std::to_string`, `std::stof`, `std::stoi`
- Containers: `std::vector`, `std::array`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_set`
- Algorithms: `std::max`, `std::min`, `std::clamp`, `std::abs`, `std::floor`, `std::ceil`, `std::lround`, `std::sort`, `std::transform`, `std::find_if`
- Function objects: `std::function`, `std::move`, `std::pair`, `std::tuple`
- Formatting: `std::snprintf`, `std::printf`
- Regex: `std::regex`, `std::regex_replace`, `std::regex_search`, `std::regex_match`, `std::smatch`

For anything else, add an `#include <header>` line at the top of the script — it passes straight through the transpiler.

### `MODU_SCRIPT(ctx)` — manual prelude

Lifecycle methods get this prelude injected automatically. If you write a free helper function and want `obj` available inside it without taking it as a parameter, call `MODU_SCRIPT(ctx)` at the top of the function body — it sets up the same `obj` facade. Advanced; rarely needed.

---

## 23. Common patterns, with full examples

These are the recurring shapes you will see in real scripts.

### Repeating timer

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class Pulser : ModuNode
{
    public float interval = 0.5f;
    private float timer   = 0.0f;

    void Begin() to timer.Start(interval);

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        if (!timer.Ready()) return;
        AddLog("tick");
    }
}
```

### Live status label

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class StatusLabel : ModuNode
{
    void TickUpdate()
    {
        obj.UI.Text = "FPS: " + IntR(ModuEngine.FPS);
    }
}
```

### WASD-driven 2D mover

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;
add ModuInput;

public class Mover2D : ModuNode
{
    public float speed = 4.0f;
    public float accel = 20.0f;
    public float drag  = 12.0f;

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        Vector2 move = input.WASDNormalized();
        TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, move * speed, accel, drag, dt);
    }
}
```

### One-shot input action (edge detection)

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuInput;

public class ShootOnce : ModuNode
{
    private bool prevFire = false;

    void TickUpdate()
    {
        bool nowFire = KeyDown(KEY_SPACE);
        bool pressed = nowFire && !prevFire;
        if (pressed) {
            AddLog("Bang");
        }
        prevFire = nowFire;
    }
}
```

### Collision-driven gate

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class TriggerGate : ModuNode
{
    [ObjectList] public string[] toEnable;
    [ObjectList] public string[] toDisable;

    void OnCollideEnter(Col other)
    {
        AddLog("Triggered by " + other->name, Type.Info);
        each toEnable.state(true);
        each toDisable.state(false);
    }

    void OnCollideExit(Col other)
    {
        each toEnable.state(false);
        each toDisable.state(true);
    }
}
```

### Clickable button via `obj.UI`

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class Clicker : ModuNode
{
    private int count = 0;

    void Begin()
    {
        obj.UI.Button.Text = "Click me (0)";
        obj.UI.OnClick(() => {
            count = count + 1;
            obj.UI.Button.Text = "Click me (" + IntR(count) + ")";
        });
    }
}
```

### Object-list driven scene state

```cpp
add ModuCPP;

public class OpenGate : ModuNode
{
    [ObjectList] public string[] toEnable;
    [ObjectList] public string[] toDisable;

    void Begin()
    {
        each toEnable.state(true);
        each toDisable.state(false);
    }
}
```

### Declarative inspector with a runtime tab

```cpp
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;

public class Patroller : ModuNode
{
    public float speed   = 3.0f;
    public Vector3 start = Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    public Vector3 end   = Vector3(10, 0, 0);

    private bool movingToEnd = true;

    inspector
    {
        Tabs
        {
            Tab("Config")
            {
                Header("Movement");
                AutoFields(speed);
                Header("Path");
                AutoFields(start, end);
            }
            Tab("Runtime")
            {
                Run(ModuGUI::TextDisabled("Moving to end: %s", movingToEnd ? "yes" : "no"));
            }
        }
    }

    void TickUpdate() { /* … movement … */ }
}
```

## 24. Good practice checklist

- **Prefer `ModuNode`** for new gameplay scripts. Use `ModuBehaviour` only when you are maintaining an older script that already uses it.
- **Import only what you use.** Each `add …;` declares a real dependency. A long, speculative import list hides what a script actually needs.
- **`public` is for configuration, `private` is for state.** If a designer should never see it, it is not public. If you want it to survive a reload, it is not private.
- **Set up once in `Begin`, run every frame in `TickUpdate`.** First-frame initialization in `TickUpdate` is a smell.
- **Multiply time-based work by `dt`.** Anything else is frame-rate dependent.
- **Use `input.WASDNormalized()` for movement.** `WASD()` makes diagonals 1.41× faster.
- **Detect button presses with an edge**, not by reading the held-state on every frame.
- **Guard against missing components** with the matching `Has*` check (`audio.HasSource()`, `ctx.HasRigidbody2D()`, `obj->hasRigidbody2D`). These calls fail silently.
- **Move physics-driven objects through `ctx.SetPosition` or `ctx.TeleportRigidbody`**, not by writing `obj->position` directly. Direct writes skip physics sync.
- **Use `obj.UI.*`** for UI-attached objects instead of raw `obj->ui.*` reads — it's a thinner, typed surface that auto-dirties.
- **Use `each list.state(true|false);`** for object-list batches instead of a hand-written loop.
- **Use the `inspector { … }` DSL** for tabs/sections/runtime status. Drop to `Script_OnInspector()` only when you genuinely need it.
- **Call `ctx.MarkDirty()` after editor-time scene mutations** so the change is saved.
- **Use `warnOnce` / `warnMissingComponentOnce`** when a script can't do its job without a component. Once per missing thing is enough; spamming logs hides real issues.
- **`SubScript` over parallel arrays** any time the data has structure. The inspector and serialization will thank you.
- **Pick one of `ModuGUI::` or `ImGui::` per file** — both work, but mixing them on adjacent lines is noisy.

## 25. Bad practice — examples of what not to do

Side-by-side examples of common mistakes, with the right shape next to them.

### 25.1 Making runtime state public

```cpp
// BAD — pollutes the inspector and gets serialized to disk.
public bool isJumping = false;
public float jumpTimer = 0.0f;

// GOOD — these are pure runtime state.
private bool isJumping = false;
private float jumpTimer = 0.0f;
```

### 25.2 Initializing in `TickUpdate`

```cpp
// BAD — runs every frame, allocates and resets repeatedly.
private bool started = false;
void TickUpdate()
{
    if (!started) {
        ctx.SetFPSCap(true, 120.0f);
        started = true;
    }
    // …
}

// GOOD — one-time work belongs in Begin.
void Begin()
{
    ctx.SetFPSCap(true, 120.0f);
}
```

### 25.3 Using `input.WASD()` for movement

```cpp
// BAD — diagonal movement is sqrt(2) faster.
Vector2 move = input.WASD();
TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, move * speed, accel, drag, dt);

// GOOD — same intent, consistent speed in all directions.
Vector2 move = input.WASDNormalized();
TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, move * speed, accel, drag, dt);
```

### 25.4 Treating a held-state helper as a press

```cpp
// BAD — fires every frame the key is held.
void TickUpdate()
{
    if (input.jump()) {
        ctx.AddRigidbodyImpulse(Vector3(0, 5, 0));
    }
}

// GOOD — detect the press edge with a previous-frame state.
private bool prevJump = false;
void TickUpdate()
{
    bool nowJump = input.jump();
    if (nowJump && !prevJump) {
        ctx.AddRigidbodyImpulse(Vector3(0, 5, 0));
    }
    prevJump = nowJump;
}
```

### 25.5 Time-based code that ignores `dt`

```cpp
// BAD — speed depends on frame rate.
obj->position = obj->position + Vector3(speed, 0, 0);

// GOOD — speed is meters per second, regardless of FPS.
ctx.SetPosition(obj->position + Vector3(speed * dt, 0, 0));
```

### 25.6 Writing `obj->position` directly on a physics object

```cpp
// BAD — bypasses the physics sync; visuals and simulation drift apart.
obj->position = startPos;

// GOOD — let the rigidbody know about the teleport.
ctx.TeleportRigidbody(startPos, obj->rotation);
```

### 25.7 Mutating scene data in the editor without `MarkDirty`

```cpp
// BAD — the change won't be saved.
void RenderEditorWindow()
{
    target->position = target->position + Vector3(1, 0, 0);
}

// GOOD — let the editor know the scene changed.
void RenderEditorWindow()
{
    target->position = target->position + Vector3(1, 0, 0);
    ctx.MarkDirty();
}
```

### 25.8 Expecting `AutoFields` to see things it can't

```cpp
// BAD — `currentWaypoint` is private; AutoFields will silently skip it.
private int currentWaypoint = 0;
inspector { AutoFields(speed, currentWaypoint); }

// GOOD — show runtime state with Run(...).
inspector
{
    AutoFields(speed);
    Run(ModuGUI::TextDisabled("Current waypoint: %d", currentWaypoint));
}
```

### 25.9 Forgetting `[ObjectRef]` / `[ObjectList]`

```cpp
// BAD — looks like a free-form string in the inspector.
public string target;
public string[] waypoints;

// GOOD — designer sees an object picker / list.
[ObjectRef]  public string target;
[ObjectList] public string[] waypoints;
```

### 25.10 Flattening structured data into parallel arrays

```cpp
// BAD — three arrays that must stay in sync by index.
public string[]   optionName;
public SceneObj[] optionEnable;
public SceneObj[] optionDisable;

// GOOD — one structured array.
SubScript Option
{
    public string    name;
    public SceneObj[] enable;
    public SceneObj[] disable;
};
public Option[] options;
```

### 25.11 Assuming components exist

```cpp
// BAD — silent failure on objects without a Rigidbody2D.
void TickUpdate()
{
    TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, target, accel, drag, dt);
}

// GOOD — warn once and skip cleanly.
private bool warnedNoRb = false;
void TickUpdate()
{
    if (!ctx.HasRigidbody2D()) {
        warnMissingComponentOnce(ctx, warnedNoRb, "Mover2D", "Rigidbody2D");
        return;
    }
    TryMoveRigidbody2D(ctx, target, accel, drag, dt);
}
```

### 25.12 Importing speculatively

```cpp
// BAD — misleading. Nothing in this script uses Engine, Input, or Experimental.
add ModuCPP;
add ModuEngine;
add ModuInput;
add ModuCPP.Experimental;

// GOOD — exactly the dependencies the script uses.
add ModuCPP;
```

### 25.13 Reaching for `to` when the body is not a single expression

```cpp
// BAD — readable as a normal body, not as a shorthand.
void Begin() to ctx.AddConsoleMessage(complicated ? "a" : "b");

// GOOD — use the shorthand only for genuinely one-expression methods.
void Begin()
{
    if (complicated) AddLog("a");
    else             AddLog("b");
}
```

### 25.14 Expecting `$"…"` to interpolate

```cpp
// BAD — this prints the literal text "Hello, {name}!"
AddLog($"Hello, {name}!");

// GOOD — concatenate values explicitly.
AddLog("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

### 25.15 Treating `Col` as a hit record

```cpp
// BAD — Col has no .normal, .point, .impulse; it's just a SceneObject*.
void OnCollideEnter(Col other)
{
    Vector3 n = other.normal;   // does not compile
}

// GOOD — Col is the other object. Use it for identity / fields,
// and raycast separately if you need a normal or hit point.
void OnCollideEnter(Col other)
{
    AddLog("Hit " + other->name + " on layer " + IntR(other->layer));
}
```

---

## 26. Experimental, reserved, and shared helpers

### `add ModuCPP.Experimental;`

Real, shipped, and used by dialogue/menu/interaction sample scripts — but explicitly **opt-in** and not part of the stable core. Treat its surface as a moving target.

Highlights:

- **Object references** — `MakeObjectRef`, `SerializeObjectRefs`, `DeserializeObjectRefs`, `ResolveSceneObjectRef`, `ResolveUITextTarget`.
- **Object/UI state** — `SetObjectEnabledState`, `SetObjectsEnabledState`, `SetUITextLabel`, `SetUITextEffects`, `SetRigidbody2DSimulated`, `TryPlayAnimationClipNamed`, `GetCurrentObjectName`, `GetObjectReferencePosition`.
- **Script settings** — `GetScriptSetting`, `SetScriptSetting`.
- **String / parse helpers** — `Trim`, `ParseInt`, `ParseFloat`, `ParseBool`, `EscapeField`, `UnescapeField`, `SplitEscaped`, `JoinEscaped`, `IsAllDigits`.
- **Editor widgets** — `DrawStdStringInput`, `DrawObjectRefInput`, `DrawAudioClipInput`, `DrawObjectRefListEditor`.

Import this only when you genuinely need a helper from it, and isolate the dependency to the script that uses it.

### `add RMeshBuilder;`

Reserved. The import is recognized and the header exists, but it currently exposes no script-facing helpers. Do not write code against it yet — wait until the documented surface lands.

### `DialoguePort` namespace

`Scripts/DialoguePortShared.h` is a shipped *shared sample helper*, not core language. It backs the dialogue / interaction / menu sample scripts (`DialogueSystem`, `InteractableObject`, `MainMenuController`) and depends on `ModuCPP.Experimental`. Useful when reproducing those patterns; do not assume new scripts need it.

### Shipped example types

The pattern docs reference enums and sub-scripts like `FacingDirection`, `MenuOrientation`, `MenuAction`, `InteractableType`, `InteractionOption`, and `MouthState`. These are *examples from shipped scripts*, not built-in primitives. Copy them as a starting point when relevant; don't expect them to exist by default.

### `obj.UI.Toggle` and `obj.UI.Input`

Reserved sub-proxies. They exist in the API surface so you can write code targeting them, but the engine doesn't have those UI element types yet. Calls currently warn-once and return defaults. Don't rely on them.

### The managed bridge (`Scripts/Managed/ModuCPP.cs`)

This is a parallel authoring path for Mono/C# tools. It exposes `Context`, `ImGui`, and `Inspector` to managed code only; current ABI version is **7**. You will not call into it from a `.moducpp` script, and `.moducpp` scripts do not call out to it. It exists; you don't need it to write gameplay.

## 28. Troubleshooting & FAQ

**My script's field doesn't show up in the inspector.**
Is it `public`? Private fields are runtime-only. Is its type supported (see [§7](#7-types-you-can-use))? Are you in a `Tab` or `Section` and forgot to add it via `AutoFields(field)` or an explicit widget? `AutoFields` only sees persisted public fields on the same class.

**`TryMoveRigidbody2D` does nothing.**
The current object probably has no `Rigidbody2D`. The helper fails silently. Gate with `if (!ctx.HasRigidbody2D()) { warnMissingComponentOnce(ctx, warnedNoRb, "MyScript", "Rigidbody2D"); return; }`.

**`OnCollideEnter` never fires.**
Both objects need physics components — a rigidbody plus a collider — and at least one of them needs to be moving. If the script is on a static prop with no collider, the collision system has nothing to detect.

**`OnCollideHold` fires way too often / not often enough.**
The default interval is 2 seconds. Override it per-script with `void OnCollideHold(Col other 0.5f) { … }` or whatever interval you want.

**My one-shot key action fires every frame.**
`input.jump()` and `KeyDown(...)` report *held* state, not a press. Detect the press edge with a previous-frame `bool` or use `KeyPressed(...)`.

**My speed/timing is different at 60 FPS vs 120 FPS.**
You forgot to multiply by `dt`. Time-based math should always be `value * dt` for per-second behaviour.

**`add ModuCPP;` doesn't seem to include `input`.**
Correct — it doesn't. Imports are independent. Add `add ModuInput;` (and `add ModuEngine;` for `ModuEngine.FPS`, audio, movement, etc.).

**`AutoFields` doesn't show a value from `Config<T>()` or a private field.**
That's by design. `AutoFields` is for persisted public fields on the current class. For everything else, draw it explicitly with the matching widget statement or with `Run(...)`.

**My editor change vanishes when I reopen the scene.**
After mutating scene data in an editor-time hook, call `ctx.MarkDirty()` so the editor knows to save.

**I get stale data when I read a `Config<T>()` value at runtime.**
You need to re-bind the settings on every hook that reads the config, not only when the inspector draws. Then call `ctx.SaveAutoSettings()` after manual changes.

**My logs are flooding with "missing component" messages.**
Use `warnOnce(ctx, warned, "...", type)` or `warnMissingComponentOnce(ctx, warned, "MyScript", "Rigidbody2D")` with a private `bool` gate. One warning is enough.

**My `$"Hello, {name}"` string prints `{name}` literally.**
`$` strings only enable embedded newlines; they don't interpolate. Use `"Hello, " + name`.

**`obj->position` works but my physics object jumps weirdly.**
Direct writes to `obj->position` bypass the physics sync. Use `ctx.SetPosition(…)` for non-physics objects and `ctx.TeleportRigidbody(pos, rotDeg)` for rigidbody-driven ones.

**Can I use `ImGui::Button` instead of `ModuGUI::Button`?**
Yes. `ModuGUI` is a `using namespace ImGui;` alias — the only Modularity-specific addition is `ModuGUI::SubsectionFoldout`. Pick one prefix per file and stick to it.

**Can I include extra std headers?**
Yes. `#include <header>` at the top of the file passes straight through. The common ones (`<string>`, `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<cmath>`, `<regex>`, `<unordered_map>`, `<functional>`) are already in scope, so you usually don't need to.

**Where is the canonical reference for keyword X / member Y?**
The terse reference is [ModuCPP_Language_Reference.md](../ModuCPP_Language_Reference.md). The topic-by-topic deep dives are under [manual/](manual/README.md) and the per-type pages are under [api/](api/README.md). This document is the single-file tour; the reference docs are the source of truth.
